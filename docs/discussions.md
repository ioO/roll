A discussion:

## Why Roll?

It all started with big waves (hence the name ;-)) in a little retreat
with a new project that required good performances.

We tried Sanic but were not satisfied with synchronuous tests and did
not understand why such a complexity so we assembled a few classes and
Roll was born!

Lately we realized that it has pretty good preformances *for our usage*
and decided to add some benchmarks and then iterate to better understand
bottlenecks and strategies to tackle these. It was fun and not
ridiculous at the end so we gave some love to the documentation and
here we are.

[A kind of presentation of Roll](https://larlet.fr/david/blog/2017/async-python-frameworks/)
has been done in November, 2017 at PyConCA.
