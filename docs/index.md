# Let’s Roll!

Async, simple, fast : pick three! Roll is a pico framework with
performances and aesthetic in mind.


## Contains

* async everywhere
* basic routing through [autoroutes](https://github.com/pyrates/autoroutes)
* extensible system through events
* decent HTTP errors
* easy to test


## Will NOT contain

* a templating system
* a lot of extensions (share yours!)
